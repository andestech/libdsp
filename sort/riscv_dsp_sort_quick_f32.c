   * @par        Algorithm
   *                The quick sort algorithm is a comparison algorithm that
   *                divides the input array into two smaller sub-arrays and
   *                recursively sort them. An element of the array (the pivot)
   *                is chosen, all the elements with values smaller than the
   *                pivot are moved before the pivot, while all elements with
   *                values greater than the pivot are moved after it (partition).
   *
   * @par
   *                In this implementation the Hoare partition scheme has been
   *                used [Hoare, C. A. R. (1 January 1962). "Quicksort". The Computer
   *                Journal. 5 (1): 10â€“16.] The first element has always been chosen
   *                as the pivot. The partition algorithm guarantees that the returned
   *                pivot is never placed outside the vector, since it is returned only
   *                when the pointers crossed each other. In this way it isn't
   *                possible to obtain empty partitions and infinite recursion is avoided.
   *
   * @par
   *                It's an in-place algorithm. In order to obtain an out-of-place
   *                function, a memcpy of the source vector is performed.
